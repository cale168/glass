		For this weekend parking will be tough. The track will be maybe 300 yards west of the pier we raced at last year. If you want, you can park at the pier and drive your sled to track, or along the roads around track. Just don't block the road, we run local towing and will tow you out of The way. Awards will be at islander bar after races. any question get ahold of George Huff.

Fees for this weekend in Hessel:<br>
All short lap races will be $25.00 with $10.00 transponders. <br> 
Enduro classes will be $125.00 with $25.00 transponders.
